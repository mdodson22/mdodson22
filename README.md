My name is Melissa Dodson and my pronouns are she/her. I am a Computer Science and Cognitive Science student at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California. I am currently working on building a portfolio including projects from my sophmore year COMP 229: Data Structures class and a couple of personal projects that I have done to deepen my programming knowledge and skills. Prior to taking my COMP 101: Introduction to Computer Science I had never coded before, and even now I am still just at the beginning of my journey learning to program. I have learned Python, Java, and C and I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
